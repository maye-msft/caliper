# caliper
Caliper is a project for managing units of measure and the conversions between them.  It is designed to be simple to use, yet comprehensive.  It includes units of measure commonly found
in science, engineering, technology and around the household.  These recognized sytems of measurement include SI, International Customary, US and British Imperial.  Custom units of measure can also be created in the Caliper
unified measurement system.  Custom units are specific to a trade or industry such as packaging where units of can, bottles,cases and pallets might be in use.
